## Recommendations

▪ Producer & Storytellers should focus on family-friendly, emotionally related stories with high-quality animation and compelling characters. Films like Inside Out,
  Up, Finding Nemo, and Coco shows the enduring appeal and commercial success of this approach.
  
▪ Expanding into underrepresented narratives and perspectives can help animated movies to reach a different dynamic of audience globally.

▪ Alternative distribution methods such as streaming platforms should be considered to adapt to evolving audience preferences and consumption patterns.


## Limitations

▪ It did not include information about audience demographics, marketing strategies which can influence a movie's performance.

▪ It lacked enough details about budgets.

▪ There is no recent date of production, which isn’t enough to give fair evaluation knowing animated movies is an ever-evolving genre



## Conclusion

In conclusion, with expansion to include newer films, this dataset presents opportunities to gain insights on animated film success factors and industry trends.
Further analysis of relationships between measures such as ratings, revenues and genres could yield additional strategic guidance for filmmakers and studios.
